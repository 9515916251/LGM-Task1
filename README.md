# LGM-Task1
I am glad to share that I have successfully completed the first basic #task1 of the Data Science intern at #letsgrowmore (LGM) Community Virtual internship program of batch July 2023.  
Details of the task: 
Source of the dataset: Kaggle
Task Name: Iris Flowers Classification 
Tool used for coding: Google Colab 
Name of the dataset : Iris Species
About the task: This task about flowers classification which is having different attributes. The dataset contains the attributes like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width and species. I have collected this data from the Kaggle where there are 50,000 datasets available. This dataset is used to build a supervised machine learning model which classifies the flowers into their respective categories. Based on the attributes like length and width it classifies flowers. I have used a machine learning model called logistic regression for better results.
